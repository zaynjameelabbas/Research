## 🚀 Works in Progress

### **1. Rethinking “Ground Truth” in AI Emotion Detection: Insights from a Human-Centred Study of Emotion Labelling**  
📌 [Coming Soon!]()  
📜 **Summary:** This study explores the limitations of AI emotion detection models trained on predefined emotion labels. Using a mixed-methods user study, we analyze how human interpretations of emotion in text-based communication diverge from standard AI-labeled datasets. The findings highlight the need for **pluralistic AI models** that accommodate individual differences in emotional expression.  

### **2. Text-Based Emotion Detection: A Literature Review**  
📌 **Status:** Literature Review Completion Phase  
📌 [Read the draft](https://github.com/zaynjameelabbas/Research/blob/main/Work%20in%20Progress/CIS6890_Zayn_Lit_Review.pdf)  
📜 **Summary:** This paper reviews **emotion detection in digital communication**, covering **emotion models, emotion datasets, machine learning-based emotion detection models, and key challenges** in the field. The study provides insights into **how AI can improve text-based emotional analysis in social media interactions**.  

### **3. Bridging the Gap Between Natural Language Processing and Explainable AI in Language-Based AI Systems**  
📌 **Status:** Research & Writing Phase  
📌 [Read the draft](https://github.com/zaynjameelabbas/Research/blob/main/Work%20in%20Progress/Final%20Rough.pdf)  
📜 **Summary:** This research explores the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Explainable AI (XAI)** to improve the interpretability and transparency of language-based AI systems. It reviews **XAI techniques for NLP models**, discusses the limitations of black-box models, and suggests strategies for **enhancing trust and accountability in AI-driven text processing**.
